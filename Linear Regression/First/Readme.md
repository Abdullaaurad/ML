# 📊 E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce customer data to understand the relationships between customer behavior patterns and yearly spending. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to predict customer spending based on their online interaction metrics.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Explore the relationships between different customer behavior metrics
- Identify key factors that influence yearly spending
- Build a predictive model for customer expenditure
- Evaluate the model performance and reliability

## 📝 Dataset
The analysis utilizes an e-commerce dataset containing customer information including:
* Average Session Length
* Time spent on App
* Time spent on Website
* Length of Membership
* Yearly Amount Spent

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project begins with comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand:
* Statistical distribution of behavioral metrics
* Relationships between different variables
* Identification of patterns and outliers

We leverage visualization techniques including:
* Jointplots to examine relationships between two variables
* Barplots to compare categorical data
* Pairplots to visualize relationships across the entire dataset

### 2️⃣ Model Development
A Linear Regression model is implemented to predict customer spending based on their behavior:
* Independent variables: Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership
* Dependent variable: Yearly Amount Spent
* Train-test split methodology (70% training, 30% testing)

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Several metrics are used to evaluate model performance:
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average magnitude of errors without considering direction
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared errors (penalizes larger errors more)
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable

### 4️⃣ Residual Analysis
Residual analysis verifies the assumptions of linear regression:
* Distribution of residuals (should be approximately normal)
* Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals)
* Q-Q plot to confirm normality assumption

## 💡 Key Insights
* The analysis reveals which customer behaviors correlate most strongly with spending
* The coefficient analysis identifies the most influential factors on customer expenditure
* The predictive model provides a framework for estimating future customer value

## 💼 Business Applications
* **Customer Segmentation**: Identify high-value customer profiles
* **Marketing Strategy**: Target resources toward behaviors that drive spending
* **User Experience Optimization**: Enhance platform features that correlate with higher spending
* **Customer Retention**: Focus on metrics that indicate long-term customer value

## 🛠️ Technical Tools
* **Python**: Primary programming language
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning implementation
* **SciPy**: Statistical analysis

## 🔮 Future Work
* Implementation of more complex models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
* Feature engineering to capture more complex behavioral patterns
* Time series analysis to track spending behavior over time
* A/B testing framework to validate improvement strategies
